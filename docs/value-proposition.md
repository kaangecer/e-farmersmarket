## The problem

Problem Consumer:
- markets are limited to specific times and locations, not accessible if one is not physically there
- pricing, availability, and product information are often unclear
- regional, organic, fresh foods

Problem Farmers:
- rely heavily on word of mouth, local markets
- decentralized platform for management
- selling directly is time-intensive for farmers

## Our solution

- discover nearby producers via map view
- chat directly with farmers for questions
- preorder or pick up/deliver products
- built-in marketing
- business analytics (revenue, growth, sales, customers feedback)

## Target user

- everyone who does their own grocery shopping (adults)
- farmers wanting to increase their reach
-
